<h2>ULTRA INSTINCT GOKU</h2>
</marquee>

<h3>Ultra Instinct is an ultimate technique that separates the consciousness from the body, allowing it to move and fight independent of a martial artist's thoughts and emotions.It is an extraordinarily difficult technique to master, even for the Hakaishin. However, angels like Whis appear to have mastered it. As a result, it is known as the "state of the gods" (神の領域, kami no ryōiki).
This technique uniquely manifests as a transformation in Son Gokū and is his most powerful form, transcending Super Saiyan Blue. Despite this, Beerus and the other gods recognize the transformation's completed form, hinting that it might not be completely unique to Gokū.</h3>

<h2>BROLY</h2>
</marquee>

<h3>Broly (ブロリー, Burorī) is a male pure-blooded Saiyan hailing from the planet Vegeta and the son of Paragus. He was born around the same time as Son Gokū and Vegeta; also the misguided antagonist of Dragon Ball Super: Broly. He is the latest of the Legendary Super Saiyans, a demonic warrior who appears every thousand years. Because of his extreme power, he was stranded on the planet Vampa by King Vegeta, where he was raised by his father until rescued years later by the Frieza Force.<h3>
