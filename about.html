                <p>Dragon Ball Super (Japanese: ドラゴンボール超スーパー Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Sūpā) is a Japanese manga series and anime television series. Its overall plot outline is written by Dragon Ball franchise creator Akira Toriyama, and is a sequel to his original Dragon Ball manga and the Dragon Ball Z television series. The manga is illustrated by Toyotarou with story and editing by Toriyama and began serialization in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine V Jump in June 2015. The anime version produced by Toei Animation aired on Fuji TV from July 5, 2015 to March 25, 2018. It follows the overall plot outline written by Toriyama, with the individual episodes written by different screenwriters.

                    Dragon Ball Super follows the adventures of Goku and his friends after defeating Majin Buu and bringing peace to Earth once again. Goku encounters beings far more powerful and defends the Earth against a powerful destructive deity. He attains the power of a god and learns his newly discovered powers under the gods of his universe. Goku travels to other universes to face more powerful opponents as well as nearly unstoppable foes. A theatrical film titled Dragon Ball Super: Broly was released in 2018, and an ONA called Super Dragon Ball Heroes, based on the events prior to the film and the arcade game of the same name, started airing in July 2018.</p>
